SUBDIRECTORY simple

The examples in this subdirectory are those used in the Getting Started
Chapter of the User Manual.

simple.occ	The basic example program
simple.pgm	A configuration for T425, 1MByte, boot down link 0
simple2.pgm	Similar configuration, but for use with imakef
simple3.occ	Basic example program for non-configured case

The basic example may be built by typing

	oc simple -t425
	ilink simple.tco hostio.lib -f occama.lnk -t425
	occonf simple.pgm
	icollect simple.cfb

When using an MS-DOS or VMS system, replace '-' by '/'

You may need to edit the file 'simple.pgm' to reflect a different
amount of memory, or if you transputer is booted down a different link.

imakef requires the use of a standard set of filename extensions.
'simple2.pgm' is identical to 'simple.pgm' except that it uses the
suffix '.c5h' for the linked unit, to indicate that it is compiled
for a T425, in HALT mode. You can use imakef to generate a makefile
as follows:

	imakef simple2.btl
	make -f simple2.mak

When using an MS-DOS or VMS system, replace '-' by '/'

Single transputer programs may be generated directly without configuring.
However, they must have a standard procedure interface.
'simple3.occ' is identical to 'simple.occ' except that it has the required
standard procedure interface. This can be built as follows:

	oc simple3 -t425
	ilink simple3.tco hostio.lib -f occama.lnk -t425
	icollect simple3.lku -t

When using an MS-DOS or VMS system, replace '-' by '/'

All of these examples can be executed on a T425 with at least
1MByte of memory, booted from link 0.

The transputer simulator, isim, which is supplied with the toolset
emulates this, so it can be used instead, in `batch quiet' mode:

Basic example:

	isim -bq simple.btl

imakef example:

	isim -bq simple2.btl

Non-configured example:

	isim -bq simple3.btl

When using an MS-DOS or VMS system, replace '-' by '/'
